# The Piano 2 keyboard

This is a fork of Ben Vallack's layout - the original designer of this keyboard and layout.

I have largely stuck with the original layout of the alpha keys (as this is genius and can't be improved upon), but tweaked the other layers a bit to suit my own brain and use case. I have also added a function key layer as I use function keys a fair bit in different applications.


This is the layout I have settled on after a few weeks of use.
